This lab is to implement a 3X3 Matrix multiplication and we just simulate with vivado, no synthesis.

After writing this lab, TA give me some suggestion about how to write a good HDL program and synthesis, because 
I wrote very bad this time, and I felt I was writing a C program.

P.S. The tb file is written by the TAs of the course.
