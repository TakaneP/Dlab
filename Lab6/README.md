I only wrote the lab6.v, other files were provided by the TA and Pr.

This lab we have to read text file from sd_card named test.txt.

This file  begins with the word “DLAB_TAG” and ends with the
word “DLAB_END”.

And we have to count how many "the" in the file and print the decimal
number to the 1602 LCD module.

The search for the word “the” shall be case insensitive
Each “the” is separated by punctuation marks or line feeds
from the other words
There shall be less than 100 occurrences of “the” in the text file
