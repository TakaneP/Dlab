This time we have to synthesis on the arty board.

We have to design a circuit to display the value of a 4-bit signed counter on the LEDs with different brightness.

BTN1/BTN0 increases/decreases the counter value.
BTN2/BTN1 increases/decreases the brightness of the LEDs
(all LEDs have the same brightness simultaneously)

We control the brightness using PWM signal.
