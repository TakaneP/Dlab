This time we design a circuit to perform UART I/O.

Goal1: Read two decimal number inputs from the UART/JTAG port
connected to a PC terminal window. The number ranges from
0 to 65535.

Goal2: Compute the Greatest Common Divider (GCD) of the two
numbers, and print the GCD to the UART terminal in
hexadecimal format.

We use tera term as the UART terminal.

P.S. The xdc file and uart.v is provided bu TA, not written by me.
