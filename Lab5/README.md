Goal1: Design a circuit to implement the sieve algorithm which can find the prime numbers.

Goal2: Once all primes between 0 and 1023 are found, the LCD will
start to display prime numbers in the following format:
  Roughly every 0.7 sec, the LCD scrolls up one number cyclically
  If BTN3 is pressed, the scrolling direction will be reversed (scrollup
  becomes scroll-down, and vice versa)
  
P.S. LCD_module.v and xdc file is provided by the TA.
